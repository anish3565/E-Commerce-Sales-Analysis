## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scipy jupyter
```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. **Open and run the analysis notebook:**
   - Navigate to and open `E-Commerce Sales Analysis.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface

## üîë Key Insights

Our analysis revealed several important insights:

- **Seasonal Patterns**: Significant sales spikes during holiday seasons and special promotion periods
- **Product Performance**: Clear identification of consistently top-performing product categories
- **Geographic Trends**: Notable regional differences in purchasing behavior and product preferences
- **Timing Factors**: Specific days of the week and hours showing consistently higher transaction volumes
- **Price Sensitivity**: Varying price elasticity across different product categories and customer segments

## üìã Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend:

1. **Inventory Optimization**: Adjust stock levels based on identified seasonal patterns to prevent stockouts during peak periods
2. **Marketing Focus**: Allocate higher marketing budget to top-performing products and during pre-peak sales periods
3. **Pricing Strategy**: Implement dynamic pricing for products showing lower price sensitivity during high-demand periods
4. **Regional Customization**: Tailor product offerings based on regional preferences identified in the analysis
5. **Promotion Timing**: Schedule promotional campaigns to align with observed high-traffic periods

## üìö Future Work

Future enhancements to this analysis could include:

- Integration of additional data sources (customer demographics, marketing spend)
- Predictive modeling for sales forecasting
- Customer lifetime value analysis
- Market basket analysis to identify product affinities
- Development of an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring
